# Estatuto Alert

This project is a Node.js-based web scraper and crawler that fetches expedition documents regarding the equal rights status (ESTATUTO DE IGUALDADE DE DIREITOS E DEVERES) for Brazilian residents in Portugal. It navigates to the Portuguese government's republic diary, retrieves the document (PDF format), extracts text content, processes it to identify names and birth dates, and then uploads the details to a database.
